## 👋 Hi there! 

My name is Kyle Groulx, I'm a fourth-year electrical engineering student at UBC. I'm an aspiring embedded software engineer. Previously, I spent 8 months as an embedded software engineer intern at [Rivian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivian/) on the vehicle core software team.

## 🌱 What I'm working on!
### 🏎️ [Solar Powered Race Cars](https://github.com/UBC-Solar/firmware_v3) 
I'm currently an the embedded software lead for the UBC Solar Racing Team, where I'm developing software for our third-generation solar powered car using Embedded C, STM32 microcontrollers and FreeRTOS. 

### 🖥️ [GLIGHTS](https://github.com/kcgroulx/GLIGHTS)
GLIGHTS is a bussiness I'm trying to start along side one of my friends. It's an LED strip that attaches to the backside of a monitor that matches the color on screen. This creates a beautiful lightshow effect while watching shows or gaming.  

### 🧠 [Neural Network Library](https://github.com/kcgroulx/Neural-Network)
I've been working on a Neural Network Library written in Python entirely from scratch (no external AI libraries!) Currently, I am able to create a simple Network that is able to classify digits from the mnist dataset with 90% accuracy. 

### 🐴 [Chess Game](https://github.com/kcgroulx/ChessGame)
A fully functioning Chess Game and AI I developed using Unity and C#. The program supports all chess moves including pawn promotion, castling and en passent. It also has legal moves generation, which displays all legal moves a piece is able to make, taking into account moves disallowed due to king safety.  

### 📡 Wanna Chat?
Have an exciting opportunity? Know a way to improve one of my projects? Or just wanna make a new friend?  
Feel free to reach out and contact me, I love talking to and getting to know new people!
