## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 

I'm Kyle Groulx, a second year electrical engineering student at UBC with a love for computers and software development. I have been coding since a young age and I have developed proficient skills in C, C# Python, Assembly, Arduino and Unity.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm working on!

### âš¡[Solar Powered Race Cars](https://github.com/UBC-Solar/firmware_v3)
I'm currently a member of the UBC Solar Racing Team, where I'm helping to develop software for our third-generation solar-powered car. I collaborate with a team of engineers across multiple disciplines to continuously improve the car's capabilities.
My responsibilities included designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software solutions for the vehicle using C and STM32 microcontrollers. I've helped develop software to retrieve data from voltage, current and temperature sensors on our car's solar panels and transmit it via a CAN bus. I'm currently working on an SD card logger, a device which will save data from the car onto an SD card as well as a Python program which will be able to visualize this data.
