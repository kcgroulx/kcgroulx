## üëã Hi there! 

My name is Kyle Groulx, I'm a third-year electrical engineering student at UBC with a love for computers and software development. I am an aspiring embedded software engineer and have experience working with C, C# Python and STM32 microcontrollers.  
Currently, I'm a software engineer intern at [Norsat Interational](https://www.norsat.com/), where I'm developing embedded software for satellite communication systems.

## üå± What I'm working on!
### üèéÔ∏è [Solar Powered Race Cars](https://github.com/UBC-Solar/firmware_v3) 
I'm currently an embedded software engineer for the UBC Solar Racing Team, where I'm developing software for our third-generation solar powered car using Embedded C, STM32 microcontrollers and FreeRTOS. 
I developed our car's drive control system, which takes in the driver inputs from the pedals, steering wheel and dashboard and sends CAN commands to our motor. It also handles features such as regenerative braking and cruise control.  
Additionally, I've developed firmware for gathering voltage, current and temperature data from our car's solar panels and transmit it via a CAN bus as well as an SD card logger which saves CAN bus data onto an SD card.

### üñ•Ô∏è [GLIGHTS](https://github.com/kcgroulx/GLIGHTS)
GLIGHTS is a bussiness I'm trying to start along side one of my friends. It's an LED strip that attaches to the backside of a monitor that matches the color on screen. This creates a beautiful lightshow effect while watching shows or gaming.  
I am in charge of all software and hardware development. The software was made using the .NET framework and C#. This application runs in the backround and gets color data from the respective areas on the screen and sends that data via serial port to an Arduino Nano, which decodes the data and sets the color of LEDs.  

### üß† [Neural Network Library](https://github.com/kcgroulx/Neural-Network)
I've been working on a Neural Network Library written in Python entirely from scratch (no external AI libraries!) Currently, I am able to create a simple Network that is able to classify digits from the mnist dataset with 90% accuracy. 

### üê¥ [Chess Game](https://github.com/kcgroulx/ChessGame)
A fully functioning Chess Game and AI I developed using Unity and C#. The program supports all chess moves including pawn promotion, castling and en passent. It also has legal moves generation, which displays all legal moves a piece is able to make, taking into account moves disallowed due to king safety.  
I added a very basic AI opponent, however, I'm currently working on a more complex version which will be able to see multiple moves ahead using Alpha-Beta pruning and level order searching algorithms.

### üì° Wanna Chat?
Have an exciting opportunity? Know a way to improve one of my projects? Or just wanna make a new friend?  
Feel free to reach out and contact me, I love talking to and getting to know new people!
