## üëã Hi there! 

I'm Kyle Groulx, a second year electrical engineering student at UBC with a love for computers and software development. I have been coding since a young age and I have developed proficient skills in C, C# Python, Assembly, Arduino and Unity.

## üå± What I'm working on!
### üèéÔ∏è [Solar Powered Race Cars](https://github.com/UBC-Solar/firmware_v3) 
I'm currently a member of the UBC Solar Racing Team, where I'm helping to develop software for our third-generation solar-powered car. I collaborate with a team of engineers across multiple disciplines to continuously improve the car's capabilities.
My responsibilities included designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software solutions for the vehicle using C and STM32 microcontrollers. I've helped develop software to retrieve data from voltage, current and temperature sensors on our car's solar panels and transmit it via a CAN bus. I'm currently working on an SD card logger, a device which will save data from the car onto an SD card as well as a Python program which will be able to visualize this data.

### üê¥ [Chess AI](https://github.com/kcgroulx/ChessGame)
A fully functioning Chess Game and AI I developed using Unity and C#. The program supports all chess moves including pawn promotion, castling and en passent. It also has legal moves generation, which displays all legal moves a piece is able to make, taking into account moves disallowed due to king safety.  
I added a very basic AI opponent, however, I'm currently working on a more complex version which will be able to see multiple moves ahead using Alpha-Beta pruning and level order searching algorithms.

### üñ•Ô∏è [GLIGHTS](https://github.com/kcgroulx/GLIGHTS)
####Watch a [Demo Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RTGtit4Xts&ab_channel=GLIGHTS)
GLIGHTS is a bussiness I'm trying to start along side one of my friends. It's an LED strip that attaches to the backside of a monitor that matches the color on screen. This creates a beautiful lightshow effect while watching shows or gaming. I am in charge of all software and hardware development. The software was made using the .NET framework and C#. This application runs in the backround and gets color data from the respective areas on the screen and sends that data via serial port to an Arduino Nano, which decodes the data and sets the color of LEDs.  



### üì° Wanna Chat?
Have an exciting opportunity? Know a way to improve one of my projects? Or just wanna make a new friend?  
Feel free to reach out and contact me, I love talking to and getting to know new people!
